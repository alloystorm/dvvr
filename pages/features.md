We have 2 build variants, HDRP & LWRP, each use a different render pipeline. And on each variant, we have 2 versions, public & private. In general new features appear in the private version first and may become available in public version later when they are more stable. And there are dedicated advanced features for private builds too.  

HDRP render pipeline offers better image quality and more effects while LWRP runs faster.
