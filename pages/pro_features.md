* Unlimited actors on stage. 
* Physics tools for XPS models. This includs 
  Bone colliders: Attach colliders to main body parts like torso and limbs so they can interact with other physics objects.
  Boobs: Control boobs movements with physics simulation. 
  Hair: Connecting hair bones with physics joints and colliders.
  Clothing: Similar to hair but for clothing. Connecting clothing bones with chains of physics joints. 
  Skirt:
  Detach object: Let certain accessory objects to fall off from the model by applying gravity and collider to them. 
* Outfit modifier. This is a sophisticated tool to customize the materials of the model to change the way they look.
