## Troubleshooting

### Content

* First time you run the PC version, it'll ask you to locate the content folder when you try to access model or motion menu. You'll need to guide it to the directory of content folder and click on the "tick" button on the top right corner to confirm. 
* It is recommended to use a content folder that is outside of your program folder, to allow multiple versions to share the same content and to avoid an issue that sometimes prevent DanceXR from locating the content. 
* The content cache file might not be fully compatible across different versions, if you start to experience issues after accessing the same content on an older version, you can try refresh the entire content to see if that solves the problem. 
* Reset config for a particular model or motion. If you messed up the configurations, you can simply delete the JSON file next to the model or motion and have everything reset for you. 


### Locate log files (PC only)

If any error happens, usually there are log entries describing that error in your log files. Therefore it is really helpful if you can locate your log files and send them to us when you report issues. 

The log files can be found in C:\Users\[your user name]\AppData\LocalLow\VR Storm Lab\DanceXR, and the file names are Player.log and Player-prev.log

Depends on the version you are running, the last folder might be slight different, for example the HD version might be "DanceXR HD", and older version might be "DanceViewerVR" etc.
