### Purchase Options

We need your support to keep the development going in order to continuously improving and adding new features to the application. 

Here are a few options where you can help us while at the same time unlock Pro features which in turn improve your experience: 

* [Make a pledge on Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/dvvr/) Be the first to enjoy new updates every month and take part in the development by providing your opinion and suggestions. 
* [Purchase PC version on Itch.io](https://stormlab.itch.io/dvvr) Itch.io releases contains both LW and HD variants but are slower than Patreon.  
* [Purchase Oculus Quest version](https://stormlab.itch.io/dancexr-quest) If Oculus Quest is your main VR platform you can choose this option to get the Oculus Quest standalone build but you won't be able to access PC versions. 
* [Download DanceXR for free on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vrstormlab.dancexr). And use the in-app purchase to upgrade to Pro version. Android version does not support VR and NSFW features are not avaialble due to platform rules.
