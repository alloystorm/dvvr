### Purchase Options

We need your support to keep the development going in order to continuously improving and adding new features to the application. 

Here are a few options where you can help us while at the same time unlock Pro features which in turn improve your experience: 

* [Purchase on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1905510/DanceXR) 

One-off purchase that grants you access to all the Pro features and future updates!


* [Become a patron on Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/dvvr/) 

Access to versions that are not available on other platform like the raytraced version and creator edition. And be the first to enjoy new updates every month and take part in the development by providing your opinion and suggestions.


* [Purchase PC version on Itch.io](https://stormlab.itch.io/dvvr) 

Itch.io releases contains both LW and HD variants but updates comes 30 days after Patreon releases.  


* [Purchase Oculus Quest version](https://stormlab.itch.io/dancexr-quest) 

If standalone Oculus Quest is your main VR platform you can choose this option to get the Oculus Quest build but you won't be able to access PC versions. 


* [Download DanceXR on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vrstormlab.dancexr). 

The Android version is optimized for touch screen input and there is an in-app purchase option to upgrade to Pro version. Please note that the Android version does not have NSFW features due to platform restrictions.
