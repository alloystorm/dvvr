We need your support to keep the development going in order to continuously improving and adding new features to the application. 

Here are a few options where you can help us while at the same time unlock Pro features which in turn improve your experience:

* Purchase PC version on Itch.io store. https://stormlab.itch.io/dvvr Itch.io releases contains both LW and HD variants but are slower than Patreon.  
* Purchase Oculus Quest version on https://stormlab.itch.io/dancexr-quest With this option you get the Oculus Quest standalone build but won't be able to access PC versions. 
* Unlock the Pro version through an in app purchase on Google Play for the Android version. You won't be able to access PC or Quest version through this option. Also note that NSFW features are not avaialble on Android version due to platform rules.
