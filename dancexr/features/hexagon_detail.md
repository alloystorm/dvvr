## Hexagon Pattern Detail Map
This is a procedural detail map that is generated on the fly. It can be used in material categories that support detail maps and the Outfit effect.

## Settings
* Density: The density of the hexagons.
* Circle: Use circle instead of hexagon.
* Size: The size of the center area of the hexagon. 
* Bump: Intensity of the bump effect of the hexagon sides. It can be negative to inverse the bump direction.
* Noise: Add a random direction to the normal map for each hexagon cell.
* Soft edge: Soften the edge of the hexagon to allow it to blend into the normal texture.
