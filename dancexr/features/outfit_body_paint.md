## Outfit Shape & Pattern
When switched to outfit mode, you can modify the parameters for generated outfit pattern. Then adjust the color and effect for each part of the outfit.

### Base Surface
Base surface is the main area of the generated outfit shape.

### Pattern Surface
Within the outfit shape area, you can choose a pattern and apply a different surface parameter to it.

### Border Surface

## Outfit Effects
Outfit can be used to create stocking, latex, plastic and metallic effects. It also has a pattern generator to create custom patterns and each part of the pattern can be assigned to a different effect.
