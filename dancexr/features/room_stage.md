## Room Stage

Room Stage is a procedural (programmatically generated) stage model with many settings for customization.

Use the presets to see how it works. You can also adjust the settings to create your own stage model.

The model is split into several parts, including the walls, the ceiling, the floor, the edges, and the back. Each part has its own settings for material and texture.
