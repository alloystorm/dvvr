## Overview
The input mapping of DanceXR is based on popular VR controllers and gamepads. 

You can have 2 thumbsticks, a dpad, left and right trigger buttons, left and right shoulder buttons, A, B, X, Y, select and menu buttons (button 1, 2 and menu for each hand in the VR context)

Each of the input above can have keyboard keys mapped to them so you can operate with keyboard only.

In addition, on PC and Android you can use mouse or touch screen to pan the camera or select and drag interactable objects.

In VR, you also have laser pointers to operate menu and drag & drop objects.

## Second Action
By default, grip button on VR controllers and shoulder buttons on gamepads are asssigned to "Second Action", which means when you hold this button while pressing another control, it will trigger a secondary action for that control, instead of the primary action. 

You can assign a different button to "Second Action" if you prefer.
