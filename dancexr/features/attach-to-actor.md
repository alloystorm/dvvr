# Attach To Actor

The "Attach To Actor" feature allows you to attach one actor model to any bone of another actor model, providing flexibility for customization and animation.

## Key Features

1. **Bone Attachment**  
   Attach an actor model to any bone of another actor. This includes basic scaling, rotation, and offset settings for adjustments.

2. **Motion Compatibility**  
   The attached model can still be assigned motion, making it compatible with the animation system.

3. **Improved Flexibility**  
   Compared to the previous accessory system, this feature offers more flexibility and works seamlessly with animations.

4. **Attachment from Selected Bone**  
   You can now attach from a selected bone of the attachment model.

5. **Non-Standard Bone Support**  
   Issues with motions that animate non-standard bones have been fixed.

## How to Use

1. Load two or more actor models.
2. Navigate to the "Attach To Actor" settings.
3. Choose an actor and a bone to attach to.
4. Use the scale, rotation, and position settings to fine-tune the attachment.
5. Ensure the order of actors is correct:
   - Choose the actors in front of you to attach.
   - Adjust the actor order using the "Move Up" or "Move Down" options in the actor tools menu.

## Notes

- The order of actors matters for correct positioning.
- This feature is ideal for creating complex animations and interactions between multiple actors.
