### Boobs Physics
Eventhough this is turned on by default it does nothing until you select the correct boobs related bones from the settings. Usually they are child bones of torso2 and have 2 of them one for each side. 

Spring, Mass, Damp
: controls physics properties of the joints. 

Limit
: controls how much rotation they can move from their parent bones

Counter Gravity
: lifts the boobs up by the selected degrees to counter the effect of gravity pulling them down. 

Collider Radius
: controls size of the collider, better to set it to a value that matches the model.

Anchor and Center
: controls the position of the joints.
