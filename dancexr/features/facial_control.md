## Overview
Facial control allows you to preview facial morphs and fine tune the XPS facial settings for your model. 

## PMX Models
For PMX models you can preview the facial morphs. Tick "Override" and then change the value for the facial morphs you want to preview. The preview will update in real time.

## XPS Models
For XPS models you can adjust neutral positions for facial morphs, fine tune each morph to your liking, and preview the morphs in real time.

### Neutral Position
You can adjust the neutral position for mouth, eyebrow and eyelids. This is useful when the neutral position is not set correctly for your model.

Each of these have different control points you can adjust. Take your time to adjust them to your liking.

### Fine Tune
Similar to the neutral position adjustments, you can also fine tune each morph with the same set of control points.
