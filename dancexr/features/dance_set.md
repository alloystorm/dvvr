A dance set can have any number of motions, with or without audio. 

In the content library, if you have a folder that contains 1 audio file and 1 or more actor motions, these data will automatically gruped into a dance set.

## Loading Dance Set

## Dance Set Settings
Dance Set have individual [settings for each motion](/dancexr/features/motion_settings), and a common [Timing & Beats](/dancexr/music_timing) settings for all the motions.

## [Remix](/dancexr/features/remix)
