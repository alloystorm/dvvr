DanceXR uses bpm and offset information of the music to drive procedural motions. 

You can setup the music timing by simply tapping the "Tap Beat" button while the music is playing. The system will calculate the bpm and offset based on your taps.

You can also manually input the bpm and offset values. The system will then use these values to drive the procedural motions.
