### Particle Dynamics

The cloth simulation system has been extended to perform physics simulation previously done by the physics engine. This includes most XPS physics tools including hair, clothing (now renamed to "Dangling physics") and skirt. 

This means better performance, unconditionally stable and much smoother result. So it is now the default option for these physics tools. You can also uncheck the "Particle Dynamics" option to go back to the old physics engine.

The configurations for the "Particle Dynamics" simulation are very different from before. Instead of spring forces, limits and damping, you use compliance and drag to control the simulation behavior and they are independent to the physics properties. 

* Inertia
* Swing compliance: resistance for swinging
* Twist compliance: resistance for twisting
* Reduction: Reduction ratio applied to the compliance at each level
* Particle Anchor: the hanging position from one particle to the next
For skirt it also has the following for controlling lateral connections
* Lateral compliance
* Lateral anchor
