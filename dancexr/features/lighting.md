You can configure sunlight and 3 groups of other light types indivudally. Each light group can have multiple lights, and different settings for color, intensity, shadows, lens flare and animations.

## Sunlight
You control sunlight position and angle by specifying orientaion and time of day. You can also set the color and intensity of the sunlight.

Sunlight has a window option that allow you to specify the shape and size of a window and having the light shine through it.

## Light Groups
For HD and RT variants, you can choose from spotlight, point light, area light, and pyramid and box light types for projection modes. Each light type has different settings for color, intensity, shadows, lens flare and animations.

## Light Animations
You can choose for the light to follow an actor, be stationary or always behind an actor for silhouette effect.
