## Overview
Feet adjustments allows you to adjust the position of the feet for your model. This is useful when the feet are not positioned correctly for your model.

### Ground Offset
Lifts the model up and down.

### Feet On Floor
Enable this to always keep the feet on the floor. This is to prevent the feet floating above ground or buried under. After enabled, you need to adjust the "Toe To Ground" value to fine tune the distance until you find the perfect value.

### Toe To Ground
Adjust the distance between the toes and the ground when "Feet On Floor" is enabled.

### Tiptoe
Tilt the feet and adjust vertical position at the same time to make the model stand on tiptoe.

### Rotation Adjustments
Inner/Outer and Twist are designed to adjust the neutral rotation of the feet, so that they are rotated correctly after animation.
