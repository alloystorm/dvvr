## Save Scene
You can save your scene setup including actors, motions, stage and configurations in a scene file in order to retrieve later.

Once saved, they can be loaded back into the scene at any time by selecting the saved scene file from the menu.

Please note that the scene file reference models & motions with their file paths. If you move the models or motions to a different location, the saved scene file will not be able to find the asset it requires.

We also have a feature called ["Scene Bundle"](scene_bundle.md) that also constains all the models and motion assets used in the scene. So you can share a scene with others without worrying about also missing assets.
