## DanceXR Discovery App
Easily Expand Your DanceXR Library with Seamless Asset Management

Introducing a powerful companion tool for DanceXR that simplifies the way you discover and use new content. Fully integrated with DeviantArt, this tool automatically handles the downloading, extraction, and installation of models and other assets directly into your DanceXR content library. No more manual setup—just browse, click, and enjoy.

Available for free on both Windows desktop and Android, it's the easiest way to enhance your DanceXR experience with fresh, high-quality content.

To install DanceXR Discovery, simply extract or place the tool inside your DanceXR root folder. Your folder structure should look like this:

```
DanceXR Root Folder
├─ content
├─ DanceXR HD Pro_WIN64
├─ DanceXR RT Pro_WIN64
├─ [other DanceXR versions]
└─ dancexr-discovery-win32-x64
```

You need to have a deviantart account and authorize us to browse and manage favourites on your behalf to allow the discovery app to work.
