## Stage Geometry & Water System
{% include video id="K3WSqEj7K-4" provider="youtube" %}

The new Stage Geometry is a highly customizable stage that can be raised or lowered to any height.
* The floor for actors and props is automatically adjusted to match the stage height.
* Physics setup is in place to allow it to interact with other objects on the stage.
* It works with loaded stage models. When the stage is lowered below ground, it will automatically cut a hole in the loaded model to make space for the stage.
* Stage height can be animated through the "auto update" system.

The new water system gives you realistic-looking water in your scene.
* It has pool, river, or ocean modes. When using the pool mode, the water size is confined to the stage geometry area.
* Use height adjustment to change the water level.
* Adjustments for visible distances both from above and below water.
* Ripples and wave intensity adjustments.
* Shaders are updated to be aware of the water level to allow realistic rendering of surfaces both above and below water.
