## Toon Shading

We've implemented proper toon shading to replace the old full screen toon effect. 

* Find the toon shading options in "Global Material" settings for each model individually.

* Globally you can turn on toon shading for all actors or stages in graphics settings. But that's just a on / off switch and you will still need to use the individual settings for each model to fine tune the effect.

* Full control of every aspect of the rendering individually! You can adjust size, brightness and softness of highlight, ambience and shadow independently.

* This works for all variants including Android, iOS and Quest. Only difference is that the HD/RT version don't support receiving shadow yet due to technical constraints.
