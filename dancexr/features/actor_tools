## Basic Operations
These are the basic operations you can do to manipulate actor models.

### Move
Actors have selection discs under them. When the UI is visible, the disc will be also visible and you can drag the disc to move the actor.

In desktop mode, you can drag with the mouse. In VR mode, you can drag with the pointer.

### Rotate & Vertical Move
While dragging the actor, you can use the mouse wheel or thumbstick left / right on your VR controller to rotate the actor.

If your mouse has horizontal scroll wheel, you can use it to move the actor up and down.

In VR mode use the thumbstick up / down to move the actor vertically.

## Tools Menu
When you click on the selection disc, the actor menu will pop up. Next to the actor name, there is a "screw driver and hammer" icon that will open the actor tools menu.
