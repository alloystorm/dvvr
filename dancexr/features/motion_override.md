## Overview
The Motion Override feature provides advanced tools to customize and enhance the motion of actors. It integrates seamlessly with the actor's rigging system, enabling precise control over body, head, hand, and leg movements. This feature is ideal for creating dynamic and synchronized animations.

## Key Features
- **Motion Presets**: Choose from a variety of motion styles, including rocking motions, ride models, and body poses.
- **Audio-Driven Motion**: Synchronize animations with audio beats for immersive experiences.
- **Body Pose Adjustments**: Control lean, height, forward/backward position, and rotation.
- **Ride Models**: Integrate ride models like hoverbikes or rocking horses with configurable properties such as acceleration and drag.
- **Rocking Motion Simulation**: Simulate rocking motions with adjustable depth, angle, and feet motion.
- **Symmetric Hand Poses**: Enable or disable symmetric hand movements.
- **Dynamic Leg Motion**: Adjust leg motion dynamically based on presets and configurations.
- **Particle Effects**: Add particle effects to enhance visual feedback during motion.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Fine-tune various parameters to achieve the desired motion effects.

## Example Use Cases
- **Limit Movements of a Dance Motion**: Use the Motion Override feature to restrict certain movements of a dance motion, ensuring that the actor's performance remains within desired limits.
    - Set position and rotation locks to control the actor's movement range.
    - Adjust the lean and height to create a more grounded appearance.
    - Optionally apply arms and legs poses to suit your needs.
- **Create a Rocking Horse Animation**: Utilize the rocking motion simulation to create a rocking horse animation.
    - Select the Rocking Horse preset from the motion presets.
    - Adjust the rocking angle and depth to achieve the desired rocking effect.
    - Choose the appropriate ride model to match the rocking horse theme.
- **Turning dance into vehecle motion**: Transform a dance animation into a vehicle-like motion.
    - Enable the ride model and configure the acceleration and drag settings.
    - Adjust the body pose to create a more dynamic and engaging performance.
    - Use the rocking motion simulation to add depth and realism to the animation.
    - Optionally, add particle effects to enhance the visual impact of the motion.
