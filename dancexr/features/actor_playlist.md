## Actor Playlist
Actor Playlist keep a list of actor models so you can skip through the list.

When you select actor from a folder, all other models within the same folder will become the playlist.

When you select actor from a tag, recent models list, or favourite list, the playlist will be the same as the list you selected from.

You can change the order of items in the playlist, and remove items if you want.

You can save a playlist and retrieve later.
