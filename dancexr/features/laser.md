# New Laser System
* All new shader that simulates stage laser realistically
* Highly customizable formation & position, allowing you to place laser array on the wall, ceilling or the ground
* New motion control system that allows finetuning motion parameters
* Random motion with custom random seed. This allows repeatable random sequence so you can save and share the random motion that you like by simply specifying the same seed number.
* Works with the enhanced Auto Update system to control color and glow of each beam individually
