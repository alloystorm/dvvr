## Overview
You can assign up to 2 motions to an actor, to allow mixing the motions together. Usually this is used when you have one motion for the body and another for the facial moves. 

If the 2 motion use the same bones, the second one will override the first. If that's not what you wanted, try to change the order the motion and see if that helps.
