## Idle Motion

### New Idle Motion (v2025.12)
We've been experimenting with new procedural motion control in order to open up new possibilities for better character controls. As part of this effort, we've added a more natural idle motion using the new tools we developed. 
More improvements will be coming for procedural motion control in future releases.
