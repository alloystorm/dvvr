Video playback allows you to play a video and have the image projected from a light source or used as a texture on wall or prop surfaces in your scene. Currently, only MP4 format is supported.

* Content location: place your video files in MP4 format in the `content/videos` folder.
* Use as projector: Go to light settings and select [video] as the cookie map. There are other settings to control the size of projected images. Use newly included presets to see how they work.
* Use as texture: In the surface settings and select [video] as the texture map. The included "Room" stage model has several presets for you to see how they work.

Video playback is synchronized with the dance music (if there is dance music loaded) and is controlled by the same playback and timeline control.

When you have a music loaded in your scene, make sure to select the "mute" option for the video so that the music from the video does not interfere with the dance music. 

You can also play the video without dance music. In this case, uncheck the "mute" option and the audio will come out from the same audio source and you can use the volume control to adjust the volume of the video audio. 

When you use the video image for projection or texture, make sure you have the correct aspect ratio selected. Since internally the image are stored in a rectangular texture and needs to be scaled back to the correct aspect ratio when projected or placed on object. 

In the LW variants (Android, Quest, Mac, iOS and PC LW), there's a "Fit Frame" option that will place the images with black bars to fit the rectangle aspect ratio. Only use this mode when you want to use a spotlight to project the image.
