## Custom Detail Map
Custom detail map allows you to add a custom detail map to the material. This map can be used to add details to the material that are not present in the base map.

There's a built-in list of detail maps that can be used, and you can place your detail maps in the texture folder of your content library to use them.

There's also a procedural [hexagon detail map](hexagon_detail.md) that can be used to add hexagon details to the material.
