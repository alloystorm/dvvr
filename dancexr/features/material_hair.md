## Hair Materials
Controls properties of the materials that are categorized as hair materials.

Hair materials uses a special hair shader that enables anisotropic effect to simulate the sheen on hair.

## Categorization
The system automatically puts materials that are named with certain keywords into the hair category. However this can sometimes be wrong, so you can manually assign materials to this category.
