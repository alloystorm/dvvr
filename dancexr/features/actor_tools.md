## Mouse and Pointer Interaction
These are the operations you can do with mouse and VR pointer.

### Move
Actors have selection discs under them. When the UI is visible, the disc will be also visible and you can drag the disc to move the actor.

In desktop mode, you can drag with the mouse. In VR mode, you can drag with the pointer.

### Rotate & Vertical Move
While dragging the actor, you can use the mouse wheel or thumbstick left / right on your VR controller to rotate the actor.

If your mouse has horizontal scroll wheel, you can use it to move the actor up and down.

In VR mode use the thumbstick up / down to move the actor vertically.

### Gizmo Cube
Gizmo cubes are virtual cubes that you can use to move and pose the actor. They are visible when the supported motion or tools are activated. Currently the following motions and tools support gizmo cubes.

* Idle Motion
* Auto Dance
* Auto Dance 2
* [Cowgirl Sex](scg_motion){: .nsfw}
* [Sex From Behind](sfb_motion){: .nsfw}
* [Sex Motion 3](sm3_motion){: .nsfw}
* Motion Override

When the gizmo cube is visible, place your mouse or pointer on one of its faces, drag to move it along the surface and use wheel or thumbstick to rotate within the surface.

Ususally there are 2 cubes for the hands, 2 cubes for the feet and 1 for the body. So you can move and adjust pose of these body parts individually.
