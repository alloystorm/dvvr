If you can't find DanceXR on Steam, it could be that it is blocked in your country, you can try the Pure edition instead.

The difference between Pro and Pure version is that the Pro has some adult only features so is age restricted on Steam, also the raytraced version is a paid DLC on Steam. The Pure has all adult features removed, but it includes the raytraced version.
