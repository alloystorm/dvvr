# DanceXR 2025.8 Release Notes

## Model Compatibility Improvements

We have made significant improvements to better support complex PMX models, particularly those with custom inheritance and IK setups. 

You can also now finetune the model behavior by controlling the toggles of inheritance, motion IK and model IK individually in the "Actor Motion Settings". 


## Simulation Improvements

* Improved friction handling 
* More accurate twisting control for joints
* New machanism for more complex simulation with attraction and force
* New experimental "Tentacle" simulation 


## Other Improvements

* Improved UI responsiveness & readability
* Improved robustness in bone mapping
* Fixed texture issue when model uses negative uv values
* Improved IK stability
* Improved boobs physics collider shape
