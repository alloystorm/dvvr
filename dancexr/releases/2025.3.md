# Keyframe Animation

2025.3 introduces a major improvements in animation support. You can now set keyframes for almost every setting values, including dropdowns and bone selections. 

**Enabling Keyframes**

To use the keyframe feature, hover over to the right side of a configurable value, click on the edit button and turn on "Keyframes". 

**Add Keyframe**

To add a keyframe, use the timeline at the bottom of the screen to move to your desired time, and then click on "Add keyframe".

**Selecting Keyframe**

To select a keyframe, select from the keyframe menu or simply move the timeline, and the related keyframe will be automatically selected.

**Changing Keyframe Value**

When a keyframe is selected, use the value slider to change the configuration value and the new value will be used as the value for the selected keyframe.

**Animation**

When the audio / motion is playing, the configuration value will be automatically interpolated between previous and next keyframe.

**Supported Value Types**

Numeric values
* Float point number
* Integer number (Keep in mind that the interpolated value will be rounded to the nearest integer)

Selection values, these values do not have interpolation, value will only be updated when the timeline reaches a keyframe.
* Dropdown selection 
* Switch selection (horizontal selection without a dropdown menu)
* Bone selection

**Auto Update Compatibility**

The old auto update system is still available however you cannot use Auto Update and Keyframe system at the same time for a value.



# Motion Accuracy

We've also improved the mapping of the motion for better hand motion accuracy. The new system maps the hand motion to non-MMD skeletons much more accurately. And we've also introduced more fine control for hand bones. You can now adjust finger orientation individually to fit the motion.

We've also fixed issues with bone morphs, allowing bone morph motions to play accurately.



# Simulation Improvements

Further improving stability and interaction with air drag and damping effects.
