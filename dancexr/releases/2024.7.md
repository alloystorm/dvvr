## Cloth Simulation Preview

Real-time "Cloth Simulation" system is now available for the built-in Dummy model as a preview. This is proper cloth simulation that controls every vertices of the cloth mesh with actual phsyics simulation. The realism is at a whole new level compared to the existing physics tools that use rigid body physics. 

Head over to the "Cloth Simulation" settings to explore and have fun! There you can

* Customize the cloth mesh. You can control the position, size and shape of the cloth mesh however you like.
* Adjust the cloth simulation settings. You can control the gravity, stiffness, damping, friction and other settings of the cloth simulation.
* Fine tune the computational parameters for best performance.

The entire simulation system runs on a separate thread so it has 0 impact on your current fps if you have spare CPU cores and the computation can be done in no more than one frame.

We are currently only enabling this for the dummy model as a preview. There are additional works to be done in the motion and model systems to allow it to be integrated with PMX and XPS models. Stay tuned for future updates!

## Motion Updates
* Arm twist corrections. In addition to the existing twist correction feature, we added check to keep the arm straight when the arm twist bones are animated incorrectly. This can be switched on/off in the motion settings.
* New Motion Unit setting for BVH. Certain BVH files may have different units for motion data. If you found bvh motion that appears to have only rotation or too much translation, try adjust this in the motion settings.
* Motion & Audio auto sync. Automatically sync audio with motion on the fly when the audio time and motion time differs by a certain amount. You can choose to either sync audio to motion or motion to audio.
* Motion interpolation curve is now turned off by default since it can cause stuttering in some cases. You can turn it on in the motion settings.
* Feet IK is turned on by default.

## Other changes
* Upgraded to the latest Unity 6
* Turned off "echo" effect for the Whisper speech to text model
