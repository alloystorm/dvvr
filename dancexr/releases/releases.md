## Release schedule

Our development team follows a monthly release cycle, where we aim to release new updates every month. 

These updates are initially made available to our Patreon supporters at the beginning of the month, followed by a release on the Steam beta branch around the 15th. Finally, the updates are rolled out to Steam main branch and all other platforms before the end of the month.
