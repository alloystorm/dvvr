# New Stage Effects
* Reworked laser system. 
    * Highly customisable motion system with random seed selection so you can repeat the randomized motion
    * You can also finetune and your own customized motion instead of the random
    * Works with the enhanced Auto Update system to control color and glow of each beam individually
* "Shadow Only" mode for ground. This allows dropping shadow on the background sky map to create a mixed reality effect.
    * This is available in both HD and LW but they work slightly differently. 
    * Within the LW version it renders only the shadow from the sunlight, and it has blur options.
    * With the HD versino it renders shadows from all lights but lacks blur settings.

* New pattern options
* New detail map to give it realistic texture
* Anisotropy effect that simulates the look of stockings
* Works better with skin materials. You can use metallic on skin now.
