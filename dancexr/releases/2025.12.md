# New Idle Motion
We've been experimenting with new procedural motion control in order to open up new possibilities for better character controls. As part of this effort, we've added a more natural idle motion using the new tools we developed. 
More improvements will be coming for procedural motion control in future releases.

# Bug Fixes and Improvements
* Fixed Quest AR version
* Refined graphics presets for Android and LW versions. (Some devices don't support MSAA well)
* Detects headset availability and init VR automatically if you choose to start VR on start
* Fixed various minor bugs and improved stability
