## Cloth Simulation

### Mesh Collider
New mesh collider option that use the model mesh as collider, resulting in near perfect interaction between simulated cloth and the model.
* Select model mesh from a list to turn into collider
* Configure depth and radius of the collision
* Optimized for max performance. However due to its nature it is still expected to be slower than the simple geometry colliders.

### String Mode
New string mode that simulates cloth made with connected strings. 
* Choose horizontal or vertical layout
* Adjustable density & resolution
* Custom made shader to render the strings without triangles

### Other cloth simulation improvements
* Added detail map options
* Improved translucent & glass rendering
* Translucent shadows in the RT version
* Improved friction & drag model for more stable and smooth simulation


## Sky & Ground Settings
* Sky color now affects volumetric fog as well
* Improved sky & ground presets

## Other Improvements & Fixes
* Realistic shadow for translucent objects in the RT version
* Eye contact stare mode
