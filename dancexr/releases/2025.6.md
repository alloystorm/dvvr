# DanceXR 2025.6 Release Notes

## New Discovery App
We are excited to introduce the new DanceXR Discovery App, which is a great way to discover content for DanceXR.

It is integrated with DeviantArt website and allows you to browse for content, and it is able to download, extract and install the assets directly into your DanceXR content library with one click.

It is available for both Windows and Android, and you can download it for free [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/dancexr-your-of-130393807).

## Softbody physics improvements
We have made significant improvements to the softbody physics for boobs and softbody physics tools, which will result in more realistic and responsive softbody behavior in DanceXR.

You can find demo videos here:

If you have the physics setup from previous versions, it is recommended to reset the configurations and apply the new presets to have the best results.

## Fixed Dithering Options
We now have a global dithering option in the global material settings. 

Dithering is the technique that renders transparent materials with opaque pixels, which eliminates incorrect ordering and flickering of materials when object or camera moves.

On older Android devices there is a big performance impact so only use it if your device can handle it.
