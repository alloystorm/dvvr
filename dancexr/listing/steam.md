Animate any model, anywhere

## DanceXR

### Description
DanceXR is a character model viewer and motion player. It supports PMX(MMD) & XNALara/XPS models and VMD motion format. Unlike other MMD players DanceXR allows almost any motion to play on any model without any manual tweaking or bone adjustments. 

It doesn't matter whether the model has IK bones or is it in T pose or A pose, the model & motion are adapted automatically on the fly by our unique motion system to ensure the maximum compatibility.

There are also tons of built-in features to enrich your experience with your favourite characters models. 
* The characters breath, blink eyes naturally and can even make eye contact with you. 
* Multiple procedural (programmatically generated) motions for you to use on your models. Including catwalk, dances and a few other motions.
* "Outfit" feature to modify the look of your model, this can create effects like stocking, latex, fishnet and so on.
* "Motion Override" to modify motion on the fly to change arm and leg pose and incorporate accessories like hoverbike into the motion flawlessly.
Just to name a few. More features are being developed added in each monthly update.  

DanceXR is previously known as Dance Viewer VR (DVVR) and has been supported by our lovely community on Patreon for years. We are now bringing it to Steam to introduce it to wider audiences. To learn more about the project follow the link down below to our website and YouTube channel.

## DanceXR Raytracing

### Description
The Raytracing version comes with raytracd effects like
* Raytraced reflection
* Raytraced shadow
* Raytraced ambient occulusion
* Raytraced global illumination

All the effects are configurable in graphics settings. It also supports both DLSS and FSR to boost performance. 

The Raytracing version is a separate binary than the main app. You can run both versions independently and set them to use the same content library.

An activation is required to unlock the pro features just like the standard version. The license can't be used interchangably between Raytracing and standard versions.  

Minimum requirement is graphics cards that support DirectX 12 and DirectX Raytracing. nVidia RTX series is recommended.

Performance warning: 
Realtime raytracing is a lot more demanding than the standard version. Expect FPS to drop by half in desktop mode comparing to standard. VR mode is supported but is currently experimental, you will need to turn on DLSS for a reasonable FPS even if you have a higher end card.

### Short Description
Raytracing version comes with realtime raytracing effects that provides the best image quality possible.
