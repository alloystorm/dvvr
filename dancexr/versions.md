## Overview
DanceXR comes in different versions with different feature sets and render techniques to suite capabilities on different platforms.

## Render Pipelines
LW, HD and RT represent different render pipelines

LW uses Unity Universal Render Pipeline, this is the most performant option that works well on mobile platforms and lower end computers.

HD uses Unity HDRP, this focus more on grphics quality but can also drive VR on higher end PCs.  

RT uses Raytracing, this has the best graphics but might not be able to run at full frame rate in VR.

HD and RT are not avaialble on mobile platforms so Android, Quest and Pico builds have LW option only.

## Feature Sets
We have Free, Pure, Pro and Creator tiers that have different features

Free version can only load one actor at a time and is lacking advanced features.

Pure version has advanced features but don't have NSFW features. 

Pro version has all features excpet Creator specific features like offline render and video capture capability.
