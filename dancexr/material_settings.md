In version 1.3.4 you'll be able to easily adjust materials for skin, hair, eyes, lips and others without needing to drill down into the material list and change them one by one. 
The program will check for certain keywords in the material names and categorise them into different groups. Previously we have overall control for skin and hair materials. In version 1.3.4 we are adding categories for eyes and lips and everything else falls under the "others" category. You can now change material settings for the entire category in one place. 
The old material list is still there if you need to adjust a particular one and the old settings should be carried over to the new version as well.
