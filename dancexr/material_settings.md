DanceXR checks for certain keywords in the material names and categorise them into different groups. Like skin, hair, eyes, lips and everything falls into the "Others" category. 

Most of the time you can simply material settings in the material category configurations without going to the material list and change them one by one. 

You can also find all the materials from the list and change them individually if necessary.
