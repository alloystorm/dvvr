# DanceXR (DVVR)


## Introduction
DanceXR is a character model viewer and motion player. It supports PMX(MMD) & XNALara/XPS models and VMD motion format. Unlike other MMD players DanceXR allows almost any motion to play on any model without any manual tweaking or bone adjustments. 

It doesn't matter whether the model has IK bones or is it in T pose or A pose, the model & motion are adapted automatically on the fly by our unique motion system to ensure the maximum compatibility.

There are also tons of built-in features to make the characters more life-like. You can see them breathing, blinking eyes naturally and even making eye contact with you. Plus there are procedural motions for you to use and more features added every month with each updates.

## Getting started

Before you start using DanceXR, you need to first prepare a content library so it knows where to find models and motions etc. On PC you'll be asked to locate your content library the first time you run the application. On Quest and Android this is a specific folder within the application data and you'll have to transfer your content onto the device into that particular folder for it to be able to find them. 

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjzxGEd8SqM&list=PLiOnKm2t3bhLV3HcABEs0xjqgrYcmDQcr&index=3) demonstrating how to setup your content folder.

## Different versions & builds
With each release we publish multiple builds, here's what each different variant means.

[Creator](pages/creator.md), Pro and Lite are 3 different feature levels. Creator being the most complete and Lite being the free version that lacks advanced features. [To read more about features](pages/features.md)

RT, HD & LW are different render pipelines that represent different graphic levels. RT uses raytracing and requires RTX hardware, HD has great image quality and LW is the fastest of all. 

## Localization
Starting from version 1.0, we added support for multiple languages. We've made the translation public so everybody can view and make suggestions.
