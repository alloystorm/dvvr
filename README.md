# DanceXR (DVVR)


## Introduction
DanceXR is a character model viewer and motion player. It supports PMX(MMD) & XNALara/XPS models and VMD motion format. Unlike other MMD players DanceXR allows almost any motion to play on any model without any manual tweaking or bone adjustments. 

It doesn't matter whether the model has IK bones or is it in T pose or A pose, the model & motion are adapted automatically on the fly by our unique motion system to ensure the maximum compatibility.

There are also tons of built-in features to make the characters more life-like. You can see them breathing, blinking eyes naturally and even making eye contact with you. Plus there are procedural motions for you to use and more features added every month with each updates.  

## Getting started

### Installation
No installation is required, simply unzip and run once you have your content folder prepared. 

### Content preparation

## Pro and Lite versions
The Lit version (previously called public release) doesn't include advance features (Such as raytracing, auto motion, multiple actors etc). However the basic functionalities are all there, including VR. The Lite version on LW pipeline is free. 
The Pro version contains the advanced features and is the quickest to get updates. It is available on all render pipelines including raytracing. It is only avaialble for patrons or if you purchase from https://alloystorm.itch.io/dvvr.  


## Render pipelines
We currently have HD (HD render pipeline), LW (Universal render pipeline) and RT (Raytracing enabled) pipelines in parallel. 

LW provides the best framerate, 

RT has the best image quality through raytracing but is not available in VR, 

HD has great render quality and is also available in VR.
