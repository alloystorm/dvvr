# DanceXR (DVVR)


## Introduction
DanceXR is a character model viewer and motion player. It supports PMX(MMD) & XNALara/XPS models and VMD motion format. Unlike other MMD players DanceXR allows almost any motion to play on any model without any manual tweaking or bone adjustments. 

It doesn't matter whether the model has IK bones or is it in T pose or A pose, the model & motion are adapted automatically on the fly by our unique motion system to ensure the maximum compatibility.

There are also tons of built-in features to make the characters more life-like. You can see them breathing, blinking eyes naturally and even making eye contact with you. Plus there are procedural motions for you to use and more features added every month with each updates.
