## Introduction

DanceXR is a universal character model viewer and motion player that supports PMX (MMD) & XNALara/XPS models and VMD/BVH motion formats. The main benefit of using DanceXR is that it allows almost any motion to be played on any model without requiring manual tweaking or bone adjustments.

Both the model and the motion can be configured to support different standard poses, regardless of whether the motion was created for T-pose or A-pose models. There is always a configuration that allows it to play perfectly on any model of your choice. DanceXR also fixes many common bone structure issues on the fly to ensure maximum compatibility.

There are also plenty of built-in features for you to enjoy. For example, the models will breathe, blink their eyes, and even make eye contact with you like a real person. There are procedural motions for you to use, and many different adjustments for you to fine-tune and change the look of your model. New features are added every month.

## Getting started

Before you start using DanceXR, you need to first prepare a content library so it knows where to find models and motions etc. On PC you'll be asked to locate your content library the first time you run the application. On Quest and Android this is a specific folder within the application data and you'll have to transfer your content onto the device into that particular folder for it to be able to find them. 

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjzxGEd8SqM&list=PLiOnKm2t3bhLV3HcABEs0xjqgrYcmDQcr&index=3) demonstrating how to setup your content folder.

## Different versions & builds
With each release we publish multiple builds, here's what each different variant means.

[Creator](pages/creator.md), Pro and Lite are 3 different feature levels. Creator being the most complete and Lite being the free version that lacks advanced features. [To read more about features](pages/features.md)

RT, HD & LW are different render pipelines that represent different graphic levels. RT uses raytracing and requires RTX hardware, HD has great image quality and LW is the fastest of all. 

## Localization
Starting from version 1.0, we added support for multiple languages. We've made the translation public so everybody can view and make suggestions.
