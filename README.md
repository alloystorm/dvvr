# DVVR Dance Viewer VR

DVVR is a realtime MMD viewer made with Unity engine. The idea is to leverage the modern rendering techniques and scripting capabilities from Unity Engine to give the MMD community a powerful viewer for them to enjoy their content on both desktop platforms and VR. 

DVVR tries to decouple motion data from models to allow possibility of using a dance motion on different models with little or no modification at all. It has many automatic adjustments bulit-in to facilitate that goal. Such as:
* Automatically create IK bones for models that without IK capability.
* Automatically create missing bone structure required by motion data.
* Custom made deterministic IK solution that removes unstability
* Automatically adjust foot position in real-time to make sure floor penetration doesn't happen at all. 

All you need to do is placing your models and dance motion data in a content folder and select motion & model in DVVR to enjoy your content with any combination you like. 

In addition to the above mentioned auto adjustments, it also has tons of features to enhance the experience
* VR support for all major VR platforms including Windows Mixed Reality
* The best image quality in its class.
* Easy adjustable lighting & environment control
* Life-like motions, such as blinking, breathing and [eye contact](pages/blog/eyecontact.md)
