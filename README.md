## Introduction

DanceXR is a versatile character model viewer and motion player that supports a range of model and motion formats including PMX (MMD) & XNALara/XPS models, as well as VMD/BVH motion formats. The most significant benefit of using DanceXR is its ability to play almost any motion on any model without requiring manual tweaking or bone adjustments.

One of the unique features of DanceXR is the ability to configure models and motions to support different standard poses. Whether the motion was created for T-pose or A-pose models, DanceXR ensures that it can be played perfectly on any model of your choice. It also fixes common bone structure issues on the fly to ensure maximum compatibility.

In addition to character models and motions, DanceXR also supports loading stage models and props such as mirrors and interactable primitive objects. Users can adjust the environment, including weather effects and lighting configurations, to suit their preferences. Moreover, DanceXR offers sophisticated graphics settings that can be adjusted to optimize performance and visual quality.

DanceXR also offers built-in features that enhance the realism of character models. Models will breathe, blink their eyes, and even make eye contact with you like a real person. Additionally, users can utilize procedural motions and make various adjustments to fine-tune and change the look of their models. With new features added every month, DanceXR offers an exciting and constantly evolving experience.

## Getting started

Before you start using DanceXR, you need to first prepare a content library so it knows where to find models and motions etc. On PC you'll be asked to locate your content library the first time you run the application. On Quest and Android this is a specific folder within the application data and you'll have to transfer your content onto the device into that particular folder for it to be able to find them. 

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjzxGEd8SqM&list=PLiOnKm2t3bhLV3HcABEs0xjqgrYcmDQcr&index=3) demonstrating how to setup your content folder.

[Creator](pages/creator.md), Pro and Lite are 3 different feature levels. Creator being the most complete and Lite being the free version that lacks advanced features. [To read more about features](pages/features.md)

RT, HD & LW are different render pipelines that represent different graphic levels. RT uses raytracing and requires RTX hardware, HD has great image quality and LW is the fastest of all. 

## Localization
Starting from version 1.0, we added support for multiple languages. We've made the translation public so everybody can view and make suggestions.
